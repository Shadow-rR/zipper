1.Accept no. of test cases t
2.We run a loop till t so that the next t lines will contain three strings separated by a space.
(Our task is to find whether the third string can be formed by the first two strings, keeping the order unchanged)
3.First we check whether the length of the third string is equal to sum of length of first two string . If not,we print "Data Set N:No"
4.If step 3 condition is met we take two pointers p1 and p2 which will initially point at the 0th index of the first and second string respectively.
We also declare flag=0,which will become 1 if string cannot be formed.
5.We run a loop from j=0 to j<l3(length of third string).Thus j is the pointer to the character of the third string.
6.First check whether the two pointers are equal and less than l3-1 or not.If yes proceed to next step else proceed to step 11.
7.Check whether the jth character of third string is present in p1th index of first or p2th index of second string.If not present in either raise flag to 1 and break.
8.If present in both the string find out i1(the index of (p1+1)th character of string1 in string3 after the jth index) and i2(the index of (p2+1)th character of second string in string3 after jth position).
Increase the pointer of that string which has the smallest index value of next character(if same then it doesn't matter which string pointer gets incremented).
9.Next check if only p1th character equals jth char then increase p1 by 1
10.Check if only p2 character equals jth char then increase p2 by 1.
11.If step 6 not satisfied check whether p1<=p2 .Check first if p1th index equals the jth index then check for p2th and jth.Increase the respective pointer if condition found true else set flag to 1 and break
12If step 11 not satisfied check first for p2 and then p1 .If none match the jth index of string 3 set flag to 1 and break
13.Last step is to check the value of flag.If flag=0 print YES else print NO.
