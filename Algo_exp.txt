The logic behind the algo is that the pointers assigned to each string will see whether the characters in string 3 is in order or not.When both pointer values are same and they have the same character then one may get confused as to which pointer should be incremented. In such a case that string pointer should be increased in which the next character is placed closer in string 3.
However when pointer points to the last index it is not possible to check the next index.So the last index values have to be checked separate .Moreover when both pointers become the last one it will be immaterial which pointer to increase.
